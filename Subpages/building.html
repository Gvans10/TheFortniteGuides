            <h1>Building</h1>
            <p>Welcome to building, on this page I'll teach you what advanced crosshair placement is, how to use it, and what piece control maps are the best to consistently improve building for competitive scenarios.</p>
            <p>First of all we must start with the basics, the 4 building pieces is the following, wall, stair, cone, and floor. If you want to get better at building you must master all of these building pieces.  </p>
            <p>After learning all of these building pieces I will show you techniques to use with them, the first thing we will cover is called "90's" which means 90 degrees because everytime you move around on your build your character will move 90 degrees when doing this technique</p>
